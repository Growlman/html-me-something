                    <h2>The Bell Tolls</h2>
                    <p>At the outset, our smol hero receives the call to adventure. The town of Dirtmouth is dead, and only our mysterious smol hero can save it. Along his way to Dirtmouth, the hero encounters their first mentor, who offers guidance. Here, after meeting with the mentor, the hero crosses the first threshold and enters the depths of Hollownest.</p>

                    <p>Down in the depths of the abandoned ruins, our hero must brave a road of trials. Along this road, he encounters other smol bugs willing to aide in his journey. Some even provide supernatural assistace, bestowing magical powers unto our smol hero to help him overcome more challenges. Ultimately, with the help of those he has met and by braving these trials in the depths, our hero experiences a death of sorts. The old gods are slain.</p>
